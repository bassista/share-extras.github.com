<h1>Help</h1>
<p>Share Extras is a community project and we do not provide commercial support for the add-ons listed on this
site. However with the help of the community we aim to improve and expand the set of available add-ons.</p>
<h2>Having Problems?</h2>
<p>If you have problems with a specific add-on then please report this to us. You may find that someone else
has already reported the problem in the project's issues project - if so then you can add a comment to that existing
report, with any additional information you have.</p>
<p>When you submit an issue report, please mention</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of the add-on</li>
<li>The version of Alfresco</li>
<li>Which web browser(s) does the problem occur in?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to try a more recent release of the add-on, or pull the latest from Git and build that.</p>
<h3>Still Unsure?</h3>
<p>If you are unsure about whether a problem you are seeing is really an issue, or if you want to discuss a wider
point, please send an email to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/share-extras-devel">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Please, do not contact individual project owners or developers individually. By using the public mailing list,
your questions and their replies become a resource which others can use, and you are more likely to receive a 
response from the group versus picking a specific individual.</p>
