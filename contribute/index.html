<h1>Contribute</h1>

<p>Share Extras is an open project and we encourage you to contribute to your favourite add-ons
by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">forking</a> the public code.</p>

<p>Non-coders can also contribute just by trying out the existing add-ons and providing 
feedback via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/share-extras-devel">mailing list</a>
or in the Issues section of the relevant project.</p>

<h2><a name="Enhancements"></a>Enhancements<a href="#Enhancements" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>An enhancement to an existing add-on may be a new feature, a translation in your local language 
or a fix for a specific issue. </p>

<p>If you have an idea for an enhancement that would benefit you or are willing to implement an 
enhancement yourself, please start by checking in the Issues section to see if anyone else has logged 
something similar. If not, you can add a new issue and tag it as an <strong>enhancement</strong>.</p>

<p>By submitting any additional code, configuration or documentation, you agree to license the content 
under the current project license. At the time of writing this is the 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="New_Add-ons"></a>New Add-ons<a href="#New_Add-ons" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>

<p>Anyone can create a new add-on project using free tools such as Git. We encourage you to publish
your code as open source on a public repository - we use GitHub but there are many others out there.</p>

<p>Once you have published your code and created an initial release, you should strongly consider
listing it on the <a href="https://addons.alfresco.com/">Alfresco Add-ons</a> site.</p>

<p>You add-on will then be available to the community to use and improve. There is no need for you
to do anything further, however, some people have expressed a desire to contribute their add-ons
to Share Extras.</p>

<p>Contributing an existing add-on will give you the benefits of being associated with a larger 
project, but it does not absolve you of responsibility! What this generally means is that you 
will remain the project leader responsible for managing the code.</p>

<p>If you are interested in contributing an existing project, then please send an email to the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/share-extras-devel">mailing list</a> in 
order to start the discussion. Please provide the URL of the public repository.</p>

<p>The Project Leader(s) will decide whether a new add-on should be accepted. If accepted, a new
project will be created within the share-extras organisation on GitHub, the existing code will
be forked to there, and share-extras on GitHub will become the main home for your code.</p>

<p>By submitting code, configuration or documentation for your add-on, you agree to license the 
content under the current project license. At the time of writing this is the 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>. You 
must have the authority to release your content under this license, but note this does not affect 
ownership of the content. </p>

<h3><a name="Top-Level_Add-ons"></a>Top-Level Add-ons<a href="#Top-Level_Add-ons" class="section_anchor"></a></h3>

<p>Once an add-on is considered sufficiently mature, it can be promoted to a top-level add-on. Top-level 
add-ons are listed in the Project Description text on the Share Extras front page. </p>

<p>The Project Owners will decide whether a sandboxed add-on should be promoted. Typical criteria for 
promotion include, but are not limited to the following. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>An acceptable project name has been defined and this is consistent across all add-on files </p></li>
<li><p>An appropriate source tree layout has been defined, consistent with the 
<a href="https://github.com/share-extras/sdk-sample-dashlet">Sample Dashlet</a> project, 
including the latest stock Ant build script <tt>build.xml</tt> and library dependencies from that project</p></li>
<li><p>All code to be consistent with the Alfresco 
<a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Coding_Standards" rel="nofollow">Coding Standards</a>, specifically 
using 4-space tabbing, spaces instead of tabs and braces generally on new lines within JavaScript and Java code. </p></li>
<li><p>A <tt>MAINTAINERS.txt</tt> and <tt>README.txt</tt> file exist in the add-on's base directory and contain 
complete and relevant information for the add-on </p></li>
<li><p>All add-on files must be packaged in an appropriate directory structure and should avoid the use of 
Alfresco-reserved packages (e.g. <tt>org/alfresco</tt> for web scripts) in most cases. The package 
<tt>org/sharextras</tt> can be used as a base package. </p></li>
<li><p>No core Alfresco or Share files should be duplicated or replaced by files within the add-on </p></li>
<li><p>Web scripts may be overridden only where required in order to implement the capabilities of the add-on.
Where overridden only modified files should exist in the add-on source tree. </li>
<li><p>Client-side files should be placed inside a project-specific directory, usually <tt>extras/components</tt>, 
and not in the base <tt>components</tt> or <tt>modules</tt> directories used by the core Share files </li>
<li><p>Client-side JavaScript should be normally be implemented in dedicated classes within the <tt>Extras</tt> or 
<tt>Extras.dashlet</tt> namespaces, using the standard Share pattern utilising 
<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/#extend" rel="nofollow">YAHOO.lang.extend</a>. JSDoc comments 
should be used to document classes and all public variables and functions. </p></li>
<li><p>All strings appearing in the add-on UI must be externalised in message bundles </p></li>
<li><p>It must be possible to package all add-on files in a single JAR file, using the 
<a href="https://github.com/share-extras/sdk-sample-dashlet">Sample Dashlet</a> build script, and the 
build should run without errors </li><li>No other files outside of the JAR file should be required in order 
for the add-on to function, aside from additional configuration which should be documented clearly </p></li>
<li><p>No errors should occur during start-up of the repository or Share web applications with the add-on installed </p></li>
<li><p>A wiki page has been defined documenting the add-on with screen shots, installation instructions, 
build instructions and known issues documented </p></li>
<li><p>The add-on should function without errors, and should have been tested, in recent versions of Firefox, 
Google Chrome and Internet Explorer </p></li>
<li><p>No issues tagged with Priority-Medium or higher relating to the add-on should be open </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Project Owners may decide to remove a sandboxed add-on which has not been promoted within a reasonable time. </p>
